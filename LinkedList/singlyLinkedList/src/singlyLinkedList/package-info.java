3 steps in creating a singly Linked list
  1. create head & tail and initialize with null
  2. create a blank node, assign a value to it & reference it to null
  3. link a blank node with head & tail
  
   our insertion in singly linkedlist algorithm is in composistion of -> o(n) : time complexity
                                                                        o(1) : space complexity
                                                                        
   traversal in singly linkedlist algorithm is in composistion of -> o(n) : time complexity
                                                                     o(1) : space complexity
                                                                     
   deletion of a node in singly linkedlist algorithm is in composistion of -> o(n) : time complexity
                                                                              o(1) : space complexity 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
   deleting entire singly linkedlist algorithm is in composistion of -> o(n) : time complexity
                                                                              o(1) : space complexity
